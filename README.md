NLU project 2 - Story Cloze Task

Source paper: [Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Commonsense Machine Comprehension (Chinese et al, 2017)](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/0576.pdf)

## Tasks
[Put your name next to tasks you are currently working on and remove tasks once you have pushed to repo]

- **Nil**:  Implement framework for training (including logging) and predicting

- **Nil**:  Implement data reader
> **Disclaimer on two above:** As we are allowed to use _any Tensorflow code_ (lit.) I'm gonna port the Machine Perception skeleton (citing that I took it from there obviously. If anyone has a issue with that reach me. 

> **ETC - Saturday** (Yet have to do a lot of MoC so I may send an SOS before then if I feel too pressured.) If y'all feel like this should be finished earlier and/or wants to do it, tell me, I'll post now the MP skeleton for you to finish cleaning and adapting it. 

- Implement embedding (word2vec)

- Implement result writer

- Implement discriminator (sentence and document neural language models)

- Implement attention

- Implement generator

- Train model (DIFFICULT!)

- Write report

## Deadlines

Friday 25: Implement disciminator

Friday 1: Implement attention and generator

Feel free to add more sections but those listed here are strongly recommended.
\section{Introduction}
You can keep this short. Ideally you introduce the task already in a way that highlights the difficulties  your method will tackle.
\section{Methodology}
Your idea. You can rename this section if you like. Early on in this section -- but not necessarily first -- make clear what category your method falls into: Is it generative? Discriminative? Is there a particular additional data source you want to use?
\section{Model}
The math/architecture of your model. This should formally describe your idea from above. If you really want to, you can merge the two sections. \textbf{Xander is on this}
\section{Training}
What is your objective? How do you optimize it?
\textbf{Xander is on this}
\section{Experiments}
This {\bf must} at least include the accuracy of your method on the validation set.
\section{Conclusion}
You can keep this short, too.
